The app is integrated with Firebase, a popular backend service, to handle user authentication, real-time database, and storage.

The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, with features such as message timestamps, username display, and message bubbles.

Users will receive notifications when new messages are received, even when the app is closed or running in the background. The code is well-organized and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build their own chatting app or learn about SwiftUI and Firebase.

The app has been tested on different iOS devices and is compatible with iOS 14 and above. The code is written in the latest version of Swift, making it suitable for anyone who wants to learn the latest techniques in iOS app development. It also follows the latest iOS development guidelines and best practices to ensure a high-quality user experience.
